# Slock app user validation program
Welcome to our program, it is a pleasure to see you here. 

We work to enable new sharing experiences and provide you with a glimpse of how blockchain technology can power new ideas.

As an alpha stage product, the app can feel a little puzzling and unpolished, in this case, please send us feedback in slack, email or by creating a Github issue.

## The Universal Sharing Network
In the rise of mobile and tablet controlled objects like smart houses and drones, it sounds sensible to create a platform in which people can profit from the shared access to those assets.

USN stands for Universal Sharing Network, a mechanism that represents IoT devices as physical assets, with a set of smart contracts. The Slock app brings this potential to the public, allowing users to rent anything that can be locked or controlled via mobile phones.

It is also public - anyone can add assets and extend its functionalities. Jump into the [Github repository](https://github.com/Trusted-IoT-Alliance/usn) for more detailed information. 

## Slock Pi
Decentralization is one of most fundamental changes that internet technologies are facing at the moment. It minimizes the impact of cyber attacks and engages the users in making important decisions as a democratic principle.

By mixing the comfort of home automation platforms, the low cost of the raspberry pi and the decentralization of blockchain the Slock Pi delivers a cutting-edge bridge to the IoT.

Get some hands-on by following our [Slock Pi guide](https://github.com/slockit/usn-mvp/wiki).
